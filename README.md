FAAST-Tube
==========

First Weekend Challenge (London Underground).

We have been asked to design the so-called **FAAST* system so that it can be deployed into the London underground network.  This has to be able to cater to the following features:

- There will be a number of trains inside the system.
- Trains will travel from station to station.
- Inside a station, when the train stops, passengers will alight and enter the carriages of the train.
- A Passenger will touch in at the station and touch out at the destination station.
- Each coach of a train can hold up to 40 passengers.
- Each train is made of a number of coaches.
- There is an optional charging system.  Here, passengers can only touch in a station (and access the train) if their account has more than 2 GBP.
